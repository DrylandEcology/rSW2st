# Overview

This vignette is an overview of how to use the functions in the rSW2analysis
package to convert arrays of rSOILWAT2 and SOILWAT2 output data into netCDFs
that adhere to
[CF conventions 1.8](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html)
and [CMIP6 conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0r8RZr_f3-8egBMMh7aqLwy3snpD6_MrDz1q8n5XUk/edit#).

Additionally, this document describes the Dryland Ecology Lab's standards and
conventions in regards to naming, metadata, and netCDF structure.

# Input Data Format and Structure

## Variable Data

The netCDF functions in this package expect an array, in which each row
represents data for a site or a gridcell. Columns represent one of three things:

* multiple different variables for one site
* one variable with multiple measurements (time series)
* one variable with a vertical component, e.g., multiple soil depth measurements

```{r, create1d, results = "hide"}
# load rSW2analysis package
library(rSW2analysis)
library(ncdf4)

# dummy data for 20 sites, 10 data points (could be 10 vars, times, or depths)
n_sites <- 20
n_meas <- 10

set.seed(133)
someData <- rnorm(n_sites * n_meas, 7, 30)
data2d <- array(someData, c(n_sites, n_meas))
```

Additionally, it is possible to have data at multiple times *and* multiple depths.
In this case, time should be organized by column, and multiple depths should be organized
sequentially in third dimension, forming a 3d array.

```{r, create3d, results = "hide"}
# dummy data for 20 sites, 10 times, 3 depths.
n_lyrs <- 3

data3d <- array(0, c(n_sites, n_meas, n_lyrs))
data3d[, , 1] <- 10 + someData
data3d[, , 2] <- 20 + someData
data3d[, , 3] <- 30 + someData
```

## Location Data

Locations all need to be on the same coordinates reference system (CRS). Data can
be either be organized on a regularly spaced grid (e.g. wall to wall simulations for
a given area) or not (e.g. project data representing plot points in a park).

If the data is on a grid, either a gridded raster file or a table of coordinates
can be provided. If the former, the coordinates will be extracted from the grid.

If the locations are gridded, the netCDF will be created with a lat and long dimension.


```{r, createLocs, results = "hide"}
# points on a regular spaced grid in the WGS84 CRS
locations <- data.frame(
  X_WGS84 = rep(c(-124.5938, -124.5312, -124.4686, -124.406), times = 5),
  Y_WGS84 = rep(c(47.90625, 47.96875, 48.03125, 48.09375, 48.15625), each = 4)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
stopifnot(nrow(unique(locations)) == n_sites)
```

If the locations are not gridded, locations must be provided in a table.
The netCDF will be created with an automatically generated *site* dimension,
and lat and long variables affiliated with each site, similar to [this example](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#_orthogonal_multidimensional_array_representation_of_time_series).

The crs_attribute list provides more information about the CRS.

## Dimension Data

NetCDFs are organized into dimensions. Dimensions have two key components: Bounds
and values. The dimensions also have other information which is designated in the
*Attribute Data* (see below).

The bounds and values arguments are critical metadata that need to match the
data in the array. Bounds data are always written as a contiguous vector,
represent the min and max of the bounds, and should overlap with one another.
The expected organization is c(start1, end1, start2, end2, ..., startn, endn).

For example, if you have an array that contains time series data
(n = 10 measurements) of one variable, then the values in the time attribute data
needs to be of length 10 the bounds needs to be of length 20.

See https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#cell-boundaries
for more information.

### Latitude (Y) and Longitude (X) Dimensions

NetCDFs created with *gridded* locations will have at least two dimensions: latitude and longitude.

The bounds and values of the latitude and longitude are determined from either the grid
or the location data within the *create_netCDF* function.

### Site (i) Dimension

NetCDFs created *without* gridded locations will have at least one dimensions: site.

Site numbers will be automatically assigned within the *create_netCDF* function,
and have affiliated lat and long variables.

### Time (t) Dimension

The user must define the bounds and values for the time dimension, as inputs to the
*create_netCDF*.

The boundary values of the continuous time dimension are the start and end of each
time interval. These values should be inputted as a vector and the expected organization is c(start1, end1, start2, end2, ..., startn, endn).

The values refer to the midpoint of each interval of the time dimension.

The bounds and values need to be in the same units.

A common unit for netCDF is days since 1900. A full list of accepted time units can
be found [here](https://ncics.org/portfolio/other-resources/udunits2/).

```{r, timeD}
## time vals
# mid point in days since 1900-01-01
time_midpoints <- c(43920, 44285, 44650, 45015, 45381, 45746, 46111,
                    46476, 46842, 47207)

## time bounds
# beginning and end of year in days since 1900-01-01
annual_time_bounds <- c(43737, 44102, 44102, 44467, 44467, 44832, 44833, 45197,
                        45197, 45563, 45563, 45928, 45928, 46293, 46293, 46658,
                        46658, 47024, 47024, 47389)
```

### Depth (z) Dimension

The user must define the bounds and values for the depth dimension.

```{r, depthD}
## depth vals
depths_max <- c(2.5, 7.5, 12.5) # midpoint  of each layer of depth

## depth bounds
depth_bounds <- c(0, 5, 5, 10, 10, 15) # min and max of each nlayer of depth
```

## Attribute Data

Attribute data pertains to the metadata contained in the netCDFs. NetCDFs are
self-documenting and require metadata attributes, providing information
necessary for interpreting the data.

Different attribute types include variable attributes, time attributes, depth
attributes, crs_attributes, and global attributes. The format of attributes is a
named list. Each attribute list has a bare minimum of required fields. Endless
other fields are optional and can be added by the user as they see fit.

### Variable Attributes

A named list describing the variable data. The *name* and *units* fields are required.

The length of the "name" and "units" fields must be the same and must match the number
of columns in the data. For example, if you have a netCDF with 10 variables,
the array should have 10 columns, and the "name" and "unit" field should each
have 10 values.

Use CMIP6 standard variable names where available. The variable names are contained in the [CMIP6-cmor-tables](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/tree/master/Tables).

```{r, VarAtt, results = "hide"}
# single variable, gridded
var_attributes <- list(
  name = "WatYrWDD",
  long_name = "Water Year Wet Degree Days",
  units = "day",
  grid_mapping = "crs: lat lon"
)

# multiple variables, gridded
var_attributes2 <- list(
    name = paste0("VarDD_", seq_len(n_meas)),
    units = rep("day", n_meas),
    grid_mapping = rep("crs: lat lon", n_meas)
)

# single variable,  not gridded
var_attributes3 <- list(
  name = "WatYrWDD",
  long_name = "Water Year Wet Degree Days",
  units = "day"
)

```

### Time Attributes

A named list describing the time dimension. The *name*, *units*, *calendar*, and
 *vals* fields are required here.

The length "vals" in the time_attribute list needs to be the same values as the
number of columns in the array.

A common unit for netCDF is days since 1900. A full list of accepted time units can
be found [here](https://ncics.org/portfolio/other-resources/udunits2/).

```{r, TimeAtt, results = "hide"}
time_attributes <- list(
  units = "days since 1900-01-01",
  calendar = "standard",
  unlim = "TRUE",
  vals = time_midpoints # mid point of year
  )
```

### Vertical (depth / Z) Attributes

A named list describing the vertical (depth / Z) dimension. The *name*, *units*,
and *vals* fields are required.

The length of the "vals" in the vertical_attribute list need to match the information
in the array passed (either the number of cols if there is no time dimension, or the length
of the third dimension if there is a time dimension).

```{r, VertAtt, results = "hide"}
vertical_attributes <- list(
  units = "cm",
  positive = "down", # depth is down, height is up
  vals = depths_max
)
```

### CRS Attributes

The CRS attributes describe the coordinate reference system (CRS),
see [CF-conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#grid-mappings-and-projections).

For other grid mappings, e.g., Albers Equal Area, see
[CF-conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#_albers_equal_area)


The only required field in the CRS attribute list is the "crs_wkt" field. Defining
the CRS using the well known text (WKT) is preferred by [netCDF convention](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#use-of-the-crs-well-known-text-format),
and is a recent (10/2020) transition incorporated into rgdal, sp, and sf.

Multiple functions exists to retrieve the WKT format from different CRS classes:

* raster package: `raster::wkt(raster::crs("EPSG:4326"))` #  proj4string -> WKT
* sf package: `sf::st_crs(4326)$Wkt` #"EPSG:4326" or "WGS84" or a proj4string -> WKT
* sp package: `sp::wkt(sp::CRS(SRS_string = "EPSG:4326"))`

```{r, CRSAtt, results = "hide"}

# CRS attributes for WGS84
crs_attributes_WGS84 <- list(
  crs_wkt = sf::st_crs("EPSG:4326")$Wkt,
  grid_mapping_name = "latitude_longitude",
  longitude_of_prime_meridian = 0.0,
  semi_major_axis = 6378137.0,
  inverse_flattening = 298.257223563
)
xy_attributes_WGS84 <- list(
  name = c("lon", "lat"),
  standard_name = c("longitude", "latitude"),
  long_name = c("Longitude", "Latitude"),
  units = c("degrees_east", "degrees_north")
)

# CRS attributes for USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic USGS version
crs_attributes_AEA <- list(
  crs_wkt = sf::st_crs("EPSG:6350")$Wkt,
  grid_mapping_name = "albers_conical_equal_area",
  standard_parallel = c(29.5, 45.5),
  longitude_of_central_meridian = -96.0,
  latitude_of_projection_origin = 23.0,
  false_easting = 0.0,
  false_northing = 0.0,
  # GRS 1980 ellipsoid
  longitude_of_prime_meridian = 0,
  semi_major_axis = 6378137.0,
  inverse_flattening = 298.257222101
)
xy_attributes_AEA <- list(
  name = c("x", "y"),
  standard_name = c("projection_x_coordinate", "projection_y_coordinate"),
  long_name = c("x coordinate of projection", "y coordinate of projection"),
  units = c("m", "m")
)
```

### Global Attributes

A named list describing the global attributes of the netCDF. This is where you describe
things like how the data was made, where the data was made, who the data was made by,
what climate models were used to create the data, etc.

The *title*, *institution*, *description*, *source_id*, *realm*, *product*, and
*contact* fields are required.

```{r, GlobalAtt, results = "hide"}
global_attributes <- list(
    title = "Project Name Annual Wet Degree Days",
    institution = "Southwest Biological Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey",
    description = "methods on how this data was made",
    source = paste(
      "SOILWAT2 (v4.2.0);",
      "rSOILWAT2 (v2.3.2);",
      "rSFSW2 (v3.1.2)"
    ),
    source_id = "SOILWAT2",
    realm = "land",
    parent_mip_era = "CMIP5",
    parent_experiment_id = "RCP45",
    parent_source = "CanESM2",
    parent_variant_label = "r1i1p1",
    product = "model-output",
    projection = "Geographic",
    grid = "WGS84",
    grid_label = "gn",
    nominal_resolution = "10 km", # calculated with calculate_nominal_resolution
    further_info_url = "https://github.com/DrylandEcology/",
    contact = "you@email.com"
    )
```

#### Nominal resolution

If the data is calculated and reported on a grid, [CMIP6 convention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0r8RZr_f3-8egBMMh7aqLwy3snpD6_MrDz1q8n5XUk/edit)
calls for the field *nominal resolution* to be contained in the global attributes.
The function \code{calculate_nominal_resolution} will calculate the nominal resolution
of your gridded data for you. However, you need to provide a raster of the grid,
the lat/long coordinate pairs, and the area that each cell in the grid represents.

```{r, Nominal, results = "hide"}
r <- raster::raster(
  xmn = -120, xmx = -90,
  ymn = 30, ymx = 50,
  crs = "EPSG:4326",
  resolution = c(0.5, 0.5)
)
r[] <- 1
calculate_nominal_resolution(r)
```

# Output Files Structure Naming Conventions

File structure should be organized by: variableName / allFilesPerVariable. Each file
will contain variable output for one time period and/or climate model.

Our naming conventions for files, strives to be similar to the [CMIP6 conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0r8RZr_f3-8egBMMh7aqLwy3snpD6_MrDz1q8n5XUk/edit#)
(see Appendix 1).

The name for each file should be in the format as follows:
**var_TableName_Project_SOILWAT2_GCM_RCP_variantLabel_gn_startT-endT.nc**

where:

* var – Shorthand name for variable that is contained in files (i.e. ppt for precipitation, WDD for wet degree days)
* Table - Relevant [CMIP6 Table](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/tree/master/Tables).
  * Table name is broken into two parts:
    * LorAorE – Land (L) or atmospheric (A) or extended (E) data
      * Note: Variables (var) fall into particular categories: L, A, or E. In many cases the variables our lab generates will not be listed in the tables presented here. In this case *use E* for extended.
    * timestep – The time-step of the data contained (i.e. the units of the time dimension (e.g. year, month)).
      * use "fx" if data is fixed and does not have a timestp
* Project – Project Name (i.e. SEUG or RangeResil, etc.)
* SOILWAT2 – Keep as is. Denotes that SOILWAT2 was used to generate these results
* GCM – Name of the GCM climate data used to drive the SOILWAT2 model (e.g. IPSL5, CCSM2-1)
* RCP – Name of experiment under which the GCM was run (e.g. RCP4.5, RCP8.5)
* variantLabel – Variant of the GCM used (e.g. r1i1p1 (CMIP5 format), r1i1p1f1 (CMIP6 format))
* gn - grid_label. "gn" is the "native grid", which should only be used if the SOILWAT2 output resolution has not been modified.
* startT – lower time bound or start of the time period contained. Units should be the date (YearMonthDay, YYYYMMDD).
* endT – upper time bound or end of the time period contained. Units should be the date (YearMonthDay, YYYYMMDD).

# Create netCDF Function and Examples

The functions \code{create_netCDF} and \code{populate_netCDF}
will create and populate a netCDF from an array. The user defines the dimensions, attributes, and locations in the functions' arguments.

The two functions work in conjunction with one another. First, an empty netCDF is created.
Then, it is filled with data.

## Example 1 - Create a 3 dimension netCDF (lat, long, time) from gridded data
```{r, 3dGridExample, results = "hide"}
outFileName <- "dummynetcdf1.nc"

# create
create_netCDF(
  data = data2d,
  has_T_timeAxis = TRUE,
  has_Z_verticalAxis = FALSE,
  time_bounds = annual_time_bounds,
  vert_bounds = NULL,
  var_attributes = var_attributes,
  time_attributes  = time_attributes,
  vertical_attributes = NULL,
  crs_attributes = crs_attributes_WGS84,
  xy_attributes = xy_attributes_WGS84,
  global_attributes = global_attributes,
  isGridded = TRUE,
  locations = locations,
  file = outFileName,
  force_v4 = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)

# populate
populate_netCDF(
  file = outFileName,
  data = data2d,
  var_names = var_attributes$name,
  has_T_timeAxis = TRUE,
  has_Z_verticalAxis = FALSE,
  isGridded = TRUE,
  locations = locations,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# check data
data2d_2 <- read_netCDF_to_array(outFileName, locations)
all.equal(data2d, data2d_2)

# check coords, times
tmp <- ncdf4::nc_open(outFileName)

lon <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "lon"))
all.equal(lon, sort(unique(locations$X_WGS84)))

lat <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "lat"))
all.equal(lat, sort(unique(locations$Y_WGS84)))

timeVals <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "time"))
all.equal(timeVals, time_attributes[["vals"]])

timeBnds <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "time_bnds"))
all.equal(timeBnds, annual_time_bounds)

ncdf4::nc_close(tmp)
unlink(outFileName)

```
## Example 2 - Create a 2 dimension netCDF (lat, long) from gridded data

```{r, 2dExample, results = "hide"}

  file = outFileName,
  data = data2d,
  var_names <- var_attributes2$name,
  has_T_timeAxis = FALSE,
  has_Z_verticalAxis = FALSE,
  isGridded = TRUE,
  locations = locations
)

# check data
data2d_2 <- read_netCDF_to_array(outFileName, locations)
all.equal(data2d, data2d_2)

# check coords
tmp <- ncdf4::nc_open(outFileName)

lon <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "lon"))
all.equal(lon, sort(unique(locations$X_WGS84)))

lat <- as.vector(ncdf4::ncvar_get(tmp, varid = "lat"))
all.equal(lat, sort(unique(locations$Y_WGS84)))

ncdf4::nc_close(tmp)
unlink(outFileName)

```

## Example 3 - Create a 3 dimension netCDF (lat, long, time) from non-gridded data

```{r, 3dNoGridExample, results = "hide"}
outFileName <- "dummynetcdf3.nc"
